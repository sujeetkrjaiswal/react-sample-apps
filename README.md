# react-starter
This  is a **react-redux** starter application with sample applications. This tries to provide a folder and code structure that may be useful when you have multiple sub-applications inside the main application, which may or may not be communicating with each other.

Redux store is nested based on the sub application, and every sub-application is inside routes' sub-folder which has all of its related files like reducers, action, components etc; and those are imported in Root application.
